Problem Statement

Welcome to Day 12! Check out this video reviewing inheritance, or just jump
right into the problem.

You are given two classes, Student and Grade, where Student is the base
class and Grade is the derived class. Completed code for Student and stub
code for Grade are provided for you in the editor. Note that Grade inherits
all the properties of Student.

Complete the Grade class by writing a class constructor (Grade(String,
String,int,int)) and a char calculate() method. The calculate method should
return the character representative of a Student's *Grade. Score as defined
in this chart: Screen Shot 2016-01-08 at 8.49.10 AM.png

Input Format

Input is already handled for you by the code pre-filled in the editor. There
are 4 lines of input containing first name, last name, phone, and score,
respectively.

Constraints
4<=|first name|,|last name|<=10
phone contains exactly 7 digits
1<=score<=100
Output Format

Output is already handled for you by the code pre-filled in the editor. Your
output will be correct if your Grade class constructor and calculate method
are properly written.

Sample Input

 Heraldo
 Memelli
 8135627
 90
Sample Output

 First Name: Heraldo
 Last Name: Memelli
 Phone: 8135627
