Problem Statement

Welcome to Day 7! Check out a video review of arrays here, or just jump
right into the problem.

An array is a series of elements of the same type placed in contiguous
memory locations that can be individually referenced by adding an index to a
unique identifier.

You'll be given an array of N integers, and you have to print the integers
in reverse order.

Good luck!

Input Format

The first line of input contains N, the number of integers. The next line
contains N integers separated by a space.

Constraints

1<=N<=1000
1<=Ai<=10000, where Ai is the ith integer in the array.

Output Format

Print the N integers of the array in the reverse order on a single line
separated by a space.

Sample Input

4
1 4 3 2
Sample Output

2 3 4 1

n = int(raw_input())
