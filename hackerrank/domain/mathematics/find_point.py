"""
Given two points P and Q, output the symmetric point of point P about Q.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer TT representing the number of testcases
Each test case is a line containing four space separated integers Px Py Qx
QyPx Py Qx Qy representing the (x,y)(x,y) coordinates of PP and QQ.

Constraints
1<=T<=15
-100<=x,y<=100

Output Format
For each test case output x and y coordinates of the symmetric point (each
point in a new line).
