The Maximum Subarray
--------------------
Given an array A={a1,a2,…,aN} of N elements, find the maximum possible sum of a

Contiguous subarray
Non-contiguous (not necessarily contiguous) subarray.
Empty subarrays/subsequences should not be considered.

Input Format
------------
First line of the input has an integer T. T cases follow.
Each test case begins with an integer N. In the next line, N integers follow representing the elements of array A.

Constraints:
-----------
1≤T≤10
1≤N≤10^5
−10^4≤ai≤10^4
The subarray and subsequences you consider should have at least one element.

Output Format
-------------
Two, space separated, integers denoting the maximum contiguous and non-contiguous subarray. At least one integer should be selected and put into the subarrays (this may be required in cases where all elements are negative).

Sample Input
------------
2

4

1 2 3 4

6

2 -1 2 3 4 -5

Sample Output
-------------
10 10

10 11

Explanation
------------
In the first case:
The max sum for both contiguous and non-contiguous elements is the sum of ALL the elements (as they are all positive).

In the second case:
[2 -1 2 3 4] --> This forms the contiguous sub-array with the maximum sum.
For the max sum of a not-necessarily-contiguous group of elements, simply add all the positive elements.
